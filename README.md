# CSE204 Final Project
Final project for CSE204: Web Development created by Hannah Anderson. Created and published May 2020.

## About
I'm a big cinephile, so for my final project I decided to create a movie trivia website with all of the information another movie-lover would want.

## Features
#### Box Office Statistics

Compiling box office statistics from 2020, I created a table that shows the top 10 movies from 2020. I included their ranking, 2020 gross, total gross, release date, and distributor. 

#### Trivia Game

I built a custom trivia game for the website that keeps track of how many questions a user answers correctly and then at the end displays that amount for them to share with a link to the website so that they can challenge their friends. 

To create the game, I used the [Open Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). The API is a JSON API that functions based on generated URLs. The documentation outlines how to generate URLs based on the category, level of difficulty of the questions, and the number of questions desired. My game forces users to play with the Entertainment: Film category, but allows them to specify difficulty and how many questions they would like. At the end of the game, users may share the game via Facebook or Twitter. If the user chooses to share via Twitter, the game will also share their score.

#### Fun Facts

In addition to the carousel of facts at the top of the page, I also included a list of 31 movie facts in their own section. If this were a real website, the idea is that this section would be updated each month with enough new facts for each day of the month.

#### Movie Information Resources

The "Resources" section of the page is meant to be a gateway for users to get more information on their favorite movies. I compiled a list of popular movie websites with descriptions of what they provide, if they have a social aspect, and how users can access them. I included the following websites:
- [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
- [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
- [Drew's Script-O-Rama](http://www.script-o-rama.com/table.shtml)
- [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
- [Flixster](https://www.flixster.com/)
- [MUBI](https://mubi.com/)
- [IMP Awards](http://www.impawards.com/)

#### Contact Form

The contact form would be a help resource if the website were real, where users could submit questions or comments. For now, the data submitted doesn't go anywhere.
